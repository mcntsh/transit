# Transit.js

A simple drop-in library for providing a refreshless browsing experience within a website using the [history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) API.

## How does it work?

Transit automatically detects inbound links and attempts to load them into the current page context via AJAX. The *page context* is an element which contains the changing content of your site (usually the `<main>` tag).

## Getting started

```Javascript
