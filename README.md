# Transit.js

A simple drop-in library for providing a refresh-less browsing experience within a website using the [history.pushState](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history) API.

**Very much a work-in-progress**

The code is a mess and needs to be commented and documented.
